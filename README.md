## ðŸ”’ Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Kali Linux

**Objective:**
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Kali Linux using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** to understand how network traffic is filtered and controlled.

**Tools Used:**

* UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
* Telnet (for testing blocked ports)

**Key Steps Performed:**

1. Installed and enabled UFW on Kali Linux.
2. Checked current firewall status and rules.
3. Added a rule to **block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)**.
4. Verified the block using Telnet (connection refused).
5. Added a rule to **allow SSH (port 22)**.
6. Removed the test block rule to restore the original state.
7. Documented all commands used.

**Learning Outcome:**
This task helped build foundational skills in firewall management and demonstrated how firewalls control incoming and outgoing traffic using rule-based filtering.
